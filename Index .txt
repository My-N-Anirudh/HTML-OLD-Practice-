CSS. You can set the following properties of a hyperlink:
We will revisit the same properties when we will discuss Pseudo-Classes of CSS.
 The :link signifies unvisited hyperlinks.
 The :visited signifies visited hyperlinks.
 The :hover signifies an element that currently has the user's mouse 
pointer hovering over it.
 The :active signifies an element on which the user is currently clicking.
Usually, all these properties are kept in the header part of the HTML document.
Remember a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited in the CSS definition in 
order to be effective. Also, a:active MUST come after a:hover in the CSS 
definition as follows:
<style type="text/css">
a:link {color: #000000}
a:visited {color: #006600}
a:hover {color: #FFCC00}
a:active {color: #FF00CC}
</style>
Now, we will see how to use these properties to give different effects to 
hyperlinks.

The following example demonstrates how to set the link color. Possible values
could be any color name in any valid format.
<style type="text/css">
a:link {color:#000000}
</style>
